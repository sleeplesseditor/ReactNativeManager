# ReactNativeManager

This is an app to demonstrate the use of React Native with Firebase and Redux. It's designed for a hypothetical manager to be able to assign shifts to employees and text them the details of their shifts. The manager can add or remove employees to their account, with authorisation and database functions handled by Firebase.

In order to get this app up and running, ensure you have XCode installed, and follow these steps:

1) cd ReactNativeManager
2) npm install
3) react-native run-ios
